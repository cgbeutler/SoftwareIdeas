# Software Ideas
A long list of software Ideas that anyone can take. I will never get around to all of them. Also, you can name them whatever you want.

I only ask that you make users come before money. Tell advertisers and businesses that they come second.

* ConfigBox - A dropbox for config files. The software lists all the programs you have installed and you check which ones you want to have backed up. Then all your configs for that software is backed up. All those tweaks and custom brushes you added to photoshop will be synced no matter where you go! (Maybe allow software folks to manage their own backups if they want to partner with you. Maybe also backup drivers and OS preferences?)
* RiffTube - A video site where video and audio are separate. You can choose which audio file/files to play while the video plays. This allows for rifftrax as well as translation into other languages. You can also follow your favorite voiceover actors or sound effects guys so that those are played by default. Now you can enjoy your anime or bollywood films with good, crowdsourced voice acting!
